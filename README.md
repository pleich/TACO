# TACO Toolsuite

The Threshold Automata for COnsensus (TACO) model checker tool suite is a
collection of tools to analyze and verify distributed algorithms, modeled as
threshold automata.

You can learn more about threshold automata, the algorithms implemented in TACO
and how to use them by visiting TACO's web page
[`taco-mc.dev`](https://taco-mc.dev).

There you will also be able to find installation instructions and the developer
documentation for TACO.

Alternatively, you can find all the documentation files TACO's website is
generated from in the [`./docs`](./docs) folder.

## Contributing

We tried to design TACO as modular as possible. We hope that this will enable
you to write your own tools for threshold automata.

You will be able to find more information about TACO's internal structure in the
developer documentation.

If you have any questions, feature requests or something is unclear feel free to
open an issue on this repository.

If you think TACO is missing a vital feature, feel free to open a PR!
