This crate provides a simple unified interface for different binary decision
diagram (BDD) libraries. It has been specifically implemented for the needs of
the model checkers in the TACO toolsuite for threshold automata.

You are welcome to use it in your project too, but be aware that the need of
TACO will be prioritized during the development of this crate.

This crate is part of the TACO toolsuite for threshold automata. You can
