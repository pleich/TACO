# TACO Interval Threshold Automaton

This crate provides a new type that represents an abstract version of threshold
automata. Specifically, it provides a threshold automaton where rule guards
are abstracted to the abstract intervals in which these rules are enabled.

This crate is part of the TACO toolsuite for threshold automata. You can
find more background and use cases, as well as related crates on the
[TACO website](https://taco-mc.dev).
