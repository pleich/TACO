# TACO 01-Counter System Model Checker

This crate contains the implementation of a model checker for threshold automata
that internally constructs a special abstract called the 01-counter system.

This model checker is part of the TACO toolsuite for threshold automata. You can
find more background on the model checker and on related crates on the
