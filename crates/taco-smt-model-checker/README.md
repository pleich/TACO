# TACO SMT Model Checker

This crate contains the implementation of a model checker for threshold automata
that fully encodes the model checking problem into an SMT query.

This model checker is part of the TACO toolsuite for threshold automata. You can
find more background on the model checker and on related crates on the
[TACO website](https://taco-mc.dev).
