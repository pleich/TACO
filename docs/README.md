# TACO User Documentation

This folder contains the user documentation for TACO, that should serve as an
introduction to the tool and its system model.

To generate the documentation website we use [MyST](https://mystmd.org/), a
documentation tool that supports Markdown dialects as well as LaTeX as its
input language.

## Install MyST Locally

See the [installation page](https://mystmd.org/guide/writing-in-latex).

## LaTeX in MyST

MyST only supports a subset of LaTeX and only a limited number of packages, when
writing new documentation pages in LaTeX please ensure that your page can be
rendered properly.

For more information follow the official
["Writing in LaTeX" guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/writing-in-latex).
